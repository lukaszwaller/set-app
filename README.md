# 🃟 Set Game

A beautiful and interactive implementation of the classic **SET** card game, built with **React**, **TypeScript**, and **Tailwind CSS**.  
Sharpen your pattern recognition skills in this fun and challenging logic game!

---

## 🧠 What is SET?

**SET** is a card game where players try to identify a "set" of three cards that satisfy specific rules based on four features:
- **Color**: red, green, or purple
- **Shape**: oval, squiggle, or diamond
- **Shading**: solid, striped, or outlined
- **Number**: 1, 2, or 3

For a valid **set**, each feature must be **either all the same or all different** across the three cards.

## 🚀 Features

✅ Fully functional SET game logic  
✅ Valid set detection and scoring system  
✅ Dynamic board that replaces matched sets with new cards  
✅ Toast notifications when game finished 
☑️ Built with performance and clarity in mind  
✅ Tailwind-powered clean UI with custom card shapes as svgs
